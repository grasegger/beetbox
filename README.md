# BeetBox

This is a opinionated fork of Rockbox. For the original README see the docs folder.

The motivation is to tinker with Rockbox for my ipod 6th gen. One of the goals is to
integrate the database with https://beets.io/ so it does not need to be generated 
on the device. (I have all my music in beets).

Some stretch goals are extensions for both beets and rockbox, like a podcatcher that 
syncs back.

## Comparison to Rockbox:

- Removed beep sound when reaching the start or end of a list.
- Removed anroid folder (will never be a target)
- Removed debian folder (will never be a target)
- Removed packaging folder (will never be a target)
- Removed gdp folder (debugging not available on ipod)
